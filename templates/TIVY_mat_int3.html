				<p class="Title3">Revisiting the previous network example with the subset {"Kevin", "Philip", and "Colin"}, you can see
					the green boxes in the matrix visualization represent the relationships within the subset members. It would be
					convenient to explore the relationships within a subset if the green boxes are near one another and would be
					much easier if there was only one green box. You'd get only one green box if the rows/columns are next to one
					another. Therefore, it is
					often useful to reorder the rows and columns of the matrix such that these nodes are next to 
					one another. In the matrix visualization, "Kevin" (4th row/column) and "Philip" (5th row/column) 
					are already next to one another but "Colin" (7th row/column) is not next to either "Kevin" or
					"Philip."</p>

				<p class='Title3' style="text-align:center">Fig. 1. Node-link diagram (left) and matrix visualization (right)
				of a network consisting eight people. The highlighted nodes and rows/columns in the node-link diagram and 
				in the matrix visualization, respectively, are a subset of the network members of interest.</p> 
				
				<p class="Title3"> There are a few ways to rearrange the rows and columns so that the three
					persons are next to one another. One way is to swap Colin's row/column with Joe's row/column. In the
					image below, the left matrix visualization shows Joe's row/column in red and Colimn's row/column in
					yellow highlight. When these two are swapped (right) Kevin, Philip, and Colin are next to one another,
					resulting in a subset of the matrix (green box) that represents relationships among the three members.
